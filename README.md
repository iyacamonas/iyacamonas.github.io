## **Who is Kali Uchis?**
Kali Uchis or Karly-Marina Loaiza was born on July 17, 1994. Daughter of an American mother and a Colombian father. Her father went back to Colombia when she was still attending school and subsequently had her spend time with her father’s family in Colombia. During high school when she lived with her mother and older siblings, she learned various instruments leading her to join a Jazz band. She often skipped class to spend time at the photo lab, making experimental short films. Her interest in photography led to her creating mixtape cover art. Skipping class and breaking the curfew set by her parents led to her being kicked out of her home. During this time, she lived in her car and wrote songs on her keyboard which would later appear on her debut mixtape Drunken Babble (2012). She also wrote poetry and did not initially intend to sing, being more interested in directing films than being in the spotlight. She was given the nickname "Kali Uchis" by her father and adopted it as her stage name
